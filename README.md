# Project Name: Predicting Baseball Statistics

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts baseball statistics. The project aims to develop advanced predictive metrics that can be used for evaluating players, optimizing team performance, and predicting game outcomes.

## Installation

To install the project, you need to do the following steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git`
2. Install the necessary libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

The project has the following components:

- `data`: contains the Lahman Baseball Database that provides a comprehensive archive of baseball statistics
- `notebooks`: contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the data cleaning, feature engineering, and model building processes
- `src`: contains Python scripts that implement the machine learning models


## Workflow

The workflow of the machine learning process is as follows:

1. Input: The data is imported from the Lahman Baseball Database
2. Pre-processing: The data is pre-processed to remove missing values, normalize data, and handle outliers
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: The data is analyzed through various techniques such as visualization and statistical analysis
4. Feature Engineering: New features are created from the available data to improve the performance of the machine learning models
5. Model Building: Several machine learning models are built and trained using the data
6. Model Tuning: The best model is selected by fine-tuning hyperparameters through cross-validation
7. Model Evaluation: The selected model is evaluated against a test dataset to assess its performance
8. Deployment: The final model is deployed for further use
