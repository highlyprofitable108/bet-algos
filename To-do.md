# Sports Outcome Predictor: Pre-implementation To-Do List

This document outlines the tasks and considerations to address before starting the implementation of the Sports Outcome Predictor project.

## To-Do List

1. **Investigate data sources and API limitations**: Research the data sources and APIs you plan to use, and identify any limitations or restrictions, such as rate limits, access fees, or data format inconsistencies. Develop strategies for handling these limitations within your application.

2. **Address data privacy and security concerns**: Consider any data privacy or security requirements related to the data sources and the nature of the data you are dealing with. Ensure compliance with relevant regulations or guidelines, such as GDPR or CCPA.

3. **Optimize performance and scalability**: Plan your database schema, indexing, and caching strategies to ensure optimal performance and resource usage. Consider the potential growth of the application and the amount of data it will handle over time.

4. **Implement error handling and logging**: Develop a strategy for handling various types of errors that may occur during data acquisition, processing, or prediction. Implement comprehensive error handling and logging to make it easier to diagnose and fix issues that may arise during development or operation.

5. **Adopt code quality and maintainability best practices**: Use tools like linters, code formatters, and static analysis tools to help ensure your code is consistent and adheres to best practices. Write clean, modular, and maintainable code.

6. **Document and comment your code**: Properly document your code with comments and docstrings, explaining the purpose and functionality of each module, function, and class. This will make it easier for others to understand and contribute to the project, as well as help you maintain the code over time.

7. **Establish version control and collaboration practices**: Set up a clear version control workflow and collaboration practices, including branching strategies, code review processes, and issue tracking, especially if you plan to work with other contributors or share your code with others.

8. **Plan for user feedback and iteration**: Develop a strategy for gathering feedback from users during development and after deployment. Use this feedback to improve your application and ensure it meets the needs of its users.

By addressing these tasks and considerations before starting the implementation, you will be better prepared to develop a successful, robust, and maintainable Sports Outcome Predictor application.
