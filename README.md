# Project Name: Sports Outcome Predictor

**Objective**: Develop a tool that can ingest various formats of sports-related data, process and store it, and use advanced algorithms like neural networks and forest regression to predict outcomes.

**Tools**: Python, GitHub, GitHub Actions, Pythonista

**Data Formats**: HTML, CSV, XLS, JSON, XML

## High-Level Flow:

### 1. Data Acquisition and Parsing:
   * Download sports-related data from various sources.
   * Parse the data from different formats (HTML, CSV, XLS, JSON, XML) into a standardized format.
   * Clean and preprocess the data to remove inconsistencies and missing values.

### 2. Data Storage:
   * Design a relational database schema to store the data in different tables based on sport or other ancillary data.
   * Implement database connection and data insertion functions.

### 3. Data Query Interface:
   * Develop an interface for users to query, review, and update the stored data.
   * Implement filtering and sorting options for the data.

### 4. Model Training and Continuous Learning:
   * Train machine learning models like neural networks and forest regression on the preprocessed data.
   * Set up a continuous training pipeline using GitHub Actions.
   * Implement evaluation metrics to measure model performance.

### 5. Simulation:
   * Develop a simulation engine that can run hundreds of thousands of simulations using the trained models.
   * Implement functionality to customize simulation settings and input parameters.

### 6. Model Update and Retraining:
   * Set up a pipeline to regularly update the stored data and retrain the predictive models.
   * Monitor model performance and track improvements over time.

### 7. Result Comparison and Model Evaluation:
   * Design and implement a database table to store actual results data.
   * Compare predicted outcomes with actual results to evaluate model performance and improve training.
   * Analyze discrepancies between predictions and actual outcomes to identify areas of improvement.

## Deliverables:

1. Data acquisition and parsing module.
2. Data storage and query interface.
3. Machine learning models for outcome prediction.
4. Simulation engine and configuration.
5. Continuous training and model update pipeline.
6. Result comparison and model evaluation module.
7. Comprehensive documentation on how to use the tool and set up the necessary environments.
