# Deployment Guide: Sports Outcome Predictor

This deployment guide provides a step-by-step process for setting up the environment, configuring, and deploying the Sports Outcome Predictor application. Following this guide will ensure a smooth and successful deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the deployment process, ensure that you have the following software and tools installed on your system:

1. Python 3.7 or higher: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
3. A suitable database system (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
4. A text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for editing code (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Sublime Text)

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the Sports Outcome Predictor repository from GitHub to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sports-outcome-predictor.git
```

Navigate to the cloned repository:

```
cd sports-outcome-predictor
```

## Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment

To create an isolated Python environment for the application, run the following command:

```
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

  ```
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On Linux or macOS:

  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 4: Configure the Database

Set up the database system of your choice and create a new database for the Sports Outcome Predictor application. Update the `DATABASE_URL` variable in the `config.py` file with the connection string for your database.

For example, for SQLite:

```python
DATABASE_URL = 'sqlite:///sports_outcome_predictor.db'
```

For PostgreSQL:

```python
DATABASE_URL = 'postgresql://username:password@localhost/sports_outcome_predictor'
```

## Step 5: Initialize the Database

Run the following command to create the necessary tables and initialize the database:

```
python manage.py initdb
```

## Step 6: Configure Application Settings

Update the `config.py` file with any additional settings specific to your deployment environment, such as API keys for data sources, logging configuration, or machine learning model settings.

## Step 7: Run the Application

Start the Sports Outcome Predictor application by running the following command:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

The application should now be running on your local machine at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Step 8: Deploy to Production

To deploy the application to a production environment, you can use various deployment options such as:

- Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers like Heroku, Google App Engine, or Microsoft Azure App Service.
- Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers like AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, or Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines.
- Containerization platforms like Docker and Kubernetes.

Follow the specific deployment instructions for your chosen platform and ensure that you configure the environment variables, database settings, and any other required settings for your production environment.

By following this deployment guide, you should have successfully deployed the Sports Outcome Predictor application to your desired environment.
